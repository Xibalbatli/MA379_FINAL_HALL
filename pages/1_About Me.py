         'I am Andrés Pū\'Alilani "Pack-a-Punch" Hall. I was born on the 15th '
         'of December in the year 2002 in the city of Honolulu, Hawai\'i. This, '
         'however, is not my hometown. How is that possible? My old man was a '
         'sailor for the United States Navy and so we were able to move around '
         'a lot (not by choice). I was raised in a small town in central Texas '
         'called Brenham. One of my favorite hobbies - which is also an expensive '
         'one - is building Lego™ sets, particularly the Star Wars™ sets. My current '
         'career goal is to commission into the United States Army as an infantry '
         'officer and serve my country until it tells me to stop serving.')
